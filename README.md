# React-How-To-Use-Outlet

This repository serves as a guide on how to use the `<Outlet />` component from the `react-router-dom` library in a React application, specifically built using Vite.

## About `<Outlet />`

In React Router, `<Outlet />` is a component that acts as a placeholder where child routes can be rendered. When you have nested routes, the parent route's component can include the `<Outlet />` component to specify the location where the child routes should be injected. It indicates the location in your component where the content of child routes will be rendered.

This repository provides a simple example demonstrating how to structure your React application, set up nested routes, and use `<Outlet />` to manage the rendering of child routes.
